Installation
------------

Extract the files from the zip file.  Copy the *.dll files into the LANDIS-II
build directory:

  C:\Program Files\LANDIS-II\v6\bin\build


Usage
-----

The zip file includes a sample of the input parameter file for demographic
seeding.  The library requires that the file has that specific name, and
that it must be located in the same folder where LANDIS-II is run (i.e., the
working directory).  This usually means alongside the scenario file.
